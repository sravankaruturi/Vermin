# Task List.

This is the Task list for the Project, Vermin and the Game.

# To DO

	# Gameplay Tasks

		# Create the Terrain Objects with Resources in them

		# Add UI Elements to display the Wood and Metal Values,
		  Population Count, the Cost and other Details. Just a 
		  Plain white image with Black text should do.

		# Move the Players

		# Use the Proper Assets for the Player.
		

		# Add all the unit Classes, like the villagers, Warriors and Catapults.

	# Perfomance Enhancements

		# Convert the Logic of Drawing in a specific colour to use
		  Actual location attribnutes instead of the Uniforms. That should be more
		  performant

	# Engine Bugs and Tasks

		# ImGUI Logger Fix --> It is broken.
		# We need text rendering for the Actual display of resources
		# ImGUI is completely broken. Not just the logs --> Pushed a fix to ignore it for now and
		  and run the program on a mac.
