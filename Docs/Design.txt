# Code Design

# A Game Manager Class to hold most of the constants.

# A Unit Class which deals with

	1. Animations
	2. Health
	3. Attack Function
	4. Death Check.
	5. Movement Function.
	6. Gather Resources

# Individual Unit Classes Like, 

	1. Villager	::	Unit
		
		-> Build the Builings Function, just the Barracks
	
	2. Warrior	:: 	Unit
		
		-> Shouldn't need any new functions.  


# A Player Class which would have the handles to all the Units and Buildigs of
a particular player.

# The Game Manager would have two different instances of this Player Class,
one for the Human and one for the AI
