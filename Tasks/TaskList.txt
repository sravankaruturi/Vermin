# Task List.

This is the Task list for the Project, Vermin and the Game.

# To DO

	# Gameplay Tasks

		# Create the Terrain Objects with Resources in them

		# Add UI Elements to display the Wood and Metal Values,
		  Population Count, the Cost and other Details. Just a 
		  Plain white image with Black text should do.

		# Use the Proper Assets for the Player.

		# Add all the unit Classes, like the villagers, Warriors and Catapults.

		# Make sure that the all the Entities belong to the Scene and the Player
		  Objects just have a handle to them, and not any sort of control over the
		  lifespan of it.


		# Remove Bounding Boxes from the Render Sequence and add a visual highlight
		  when a Unit is selected. Like, a different Colour perhaps.

		# Deal with the Catapult Stuff

		# Create Add Building Function

		# Create Add Unit Function

		# Call AddBuilding and AddUnit from ImGUI

	# Perfomance Enhancements

		# Convert the Logic of Drawing in a specific colour to use
		  Actual location attribnutes instead of the Uniforms. That should be more
		  performant
